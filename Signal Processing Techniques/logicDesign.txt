"""
Simulates a feedforward excitation circuit with three pyramidal neurons.
This models the propagation of information across multiple regions of the 
brain.
"""

1. Instantiate presynaptic neuron

2. Instantiate intermediary neuron

2. Instantiate post-synaptic neuron

3. Access JSON with graph and configure arrangement of neurons
   Model feedfoward excitation circuit first

4. Let presynaptic neuron discharge an action potential

5. Let presynaptic neuron release virtual neurotransmitters

6. Let intermediary neuron receive virtual neurotransmitters

7. Let intermediary neuron integrate electrical signals
        Will need to check if this meets activation threshold

8. Let intermediary neuron discharge an action potential

9. Let intermediary neuron release virutal neurotransmitters

10. Let postsynaptic neuron receive virtual neurotransmitters

11. Let postsynaptic neuron integrate electrical signals
        Will need to check if this meets activation threshold

I might need to construct a .py file that contains every possible
