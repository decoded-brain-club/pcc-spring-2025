# Project Title
Neuron Simulation

# Project Description
A single-neuron electrophysiological neuromap is a theoretical and hyper-precise model of the brain whose resolution goes beyond the level of synchronous neurons. With such a neuromap, it would be possible to observe the propagation of electricity in the entire brain as it functions and processes information. Therefore, the goal is to start constructing this neuromap by starting at the most microscopic level and working upwards. 

# Tasks
- Implement known properties of neuron cell membrane, including but not limited to Nernst equilibrium and Hodgkin-Huxley model.
- Research randomness libraries in Python to account for variation in neuron properties, such as quantity of dendrites and density of ion channels.
