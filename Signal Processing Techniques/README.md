# Project Title
Neuron Simulation && Signal Processing Techniques

# Project Description
A single-neuron electrophysiological neuromap is a theoretical and hyper-precise model of the brain whose resolution goes beyond the level of synchronous neurons. With such a neuromap, it would be possible to observe the propagation of electricity in the entire brain as it functions and processes information. Therefore, the goal is to start constructing this neuromap by starting at the most microscopic level and working upwards. 

Signal processing techniques will be used to cross-reference simulated neuron behavior with recorded EEG data.

# Tasks
1. Find software that can handle 3D rendering and behavior of neurons.
2. Consider what data structure to use that can handle the behavior of neurons. A tree data structure was suggested.
