# Project Title
Cybersecurity of BCIs
# Project Description
1. Understand the encryption algorithm
2. Simulate communication between a prosthetic limb and your own server (“the cloud”).
3. Implement an encryption algorithm that protects simulation.
4. A research presentation on the field.

# Tasks

Jamaal
1. Find a “textbook” in encryption for general overview
2. Change focus to prosthetic limb encryption (how is this special?)
3. Save your links and save your article and research references
#Use APA, Harvard, MLA reference to keep just the relevant information
#You need access to research library 
#See socially assistive robotics: Maja J Matarić - Google Scholar
4. Look for implementable algorithms to test.
5. Think in terms of slides and presentation

Leo
1. Research simulation infrastructure
2. Develop a plan to implement algorithm into simulation.
