# Cybersecurity of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
> Exploring the security challenges and defenses in Brain-Computer Interfaces.

## About This Project
This repository is dedicated to exploring, researching, and prototyping security solutions for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). As BCIs become more integrated into healthcare, accessibility, and even consumer applications, the cybersecurity risks grow significantly.

### Our Goal
- Identify vulnerabilities in BCIs
- Develop proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits and defenses
- Explore encryption, authentication, and AI-based security solutions
- Prototype creative BCI applications while securing them

## Introduction
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the human brain and external devices. They have applications in:
- Healthcare (e.g., prosthetics, epilepsy treatment)
- Assistive Technologies (e.g., controlling computers with thoughts)
- Neuroscience Research
- Gaming and Augmented Reality

However, BCIs introduce critical cybersecurity challenges such as data privacy risks, signal spoofing, and AI-driven cyberattacks.

## Security Threats in BCIs
| Threat | Description |
|--------|------------|
| Neural Data Theft | BCIs collect sensitive brainwave data, which can be stolen and misused. |
| Spoofing Attacks | Fake neural signals can be injected into a system. |
| Malware Attacks | BCIs can be infected with malware to manipulate brain activity. |
| Denial of Service (DoS) | Attackers can disrupt or overload BCI systems. |
| Brainwave Surveillance | Unauthorized entities may try to monitor brain activity for profiling. |

## Attack Vectors
The security risks in BCIs stem from multiple attack surfaces:

- Sensors and Electrodes – Vulnerable to signal interference and spoofing.
- Processing Units – Targeted for malware and unauthorized modifications.
- Wireless Communication – Susceptible to interception and jamming.
- Cloud and Data Storage – Neural data breaches can compromise privacy.
- Firmware and Hardware – Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in hardware or firmware updates.

## Defensive Measures
### Encryption and Secure Communication
- End-to-end encryption for neural data.
- Quantum-resistant cryptography for future-proof security.

### Authentication and Access Control
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to verify users.
- Zero-Trust Security Models to prevent unauthorized access.

### AI-Driven Security
- Adversarial AI defense to detect manipulated neural data.
- Differential Privacy to protect identity in datasets.

### Intrusion Detection
- Real-time monitoring of BCI activity.
- Anomaly detection for suspicious signal patterns.
